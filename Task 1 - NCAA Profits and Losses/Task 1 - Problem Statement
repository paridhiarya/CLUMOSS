**POWER BI Task 1**

**Dataset**
We use a data set that breaks down NCAA athletic department expenses and revenues by year.
(sent as a .xlsx file)

**Problem Description:**
-Create a new field in Power Query (using M) called Total Profits. This field will be calculated by subtracting Total Expenses from Total Revenues and then adding Excess Transfers Back.
    a. The background is that in the past few years, the NCAA has allowed schools to exclude money that was transferred back to the primary institution (from the athletic department) from showing as profits. By adding back in Excess Transfers Back we are finding the total amount of money generated by the different athletic departments
    b. Definition: Positive net revenues generated by athletics and transferred to the institution for non-athletics purposes. These funds are in excess of the transfers subtracted from the institutional and governmental funds allocated to athletics.
-Create a KPI dashboard that includes 3 high-level measures: Total Revenues, Total Expenses, and Total Profits. 
-Must include a trend line for each category and breakdown by conference.
-Indicate that this view is the Summary-level view within the header area. 
-The colors and design of the header section are at your discretion.
